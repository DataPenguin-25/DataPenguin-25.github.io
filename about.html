                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p class="hero-title">Data Analyst</p>
                <p>I am a data analyst who brings more than fifteen years of professional experience in client relations, team leadership, and business operations to the field of analytics. My career has afforded me the privilege of serving clients across the automotive, construction, and international business sectors, where I have consistently been recognised for my ability to communicate complex technical information with clarity and professionalism.</p>

            <h2>My Journey into Data Analytics</h2>
            <p>My path to data analytics was shaped by years of hands-on problem solving and client-focused work. As a Service Manager at Rehbein Ford, I directed a five-member technical team while developing Excel-based dashboards to monitor performance metrics and identify opportunities for operational improvement. In that role, I learned that data, when presented thoughtfully, has the power to transform business decisions and strengthen client relationships.</p>
            <p>These experiences inspired my formal transition into data analytics. I hold a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater and am currently completing the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Bootcamp. I also maintain CompTIA Tech+ certification and have studied Civil Engineering at Politechnika Warszawska in Warsaw, Poland, where I developed foundational programming and mathematical skills.</p>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>International Experience</h2>
            <p>I have lived and worked internationally for several years, including an extended period in Warsaw, Poland, where I managed B2B client relationships and taught English to corporate professionals from Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian backgrounds. This experience strengthened my cross-cultural communication abilities and reinforced my commitment to clear, empathetic stakeholder engagement.</p>

I excel at translating complex information into clear, actionable insights for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Throughout my career, I have been consistently praised for my interpersonal skills, my patience in explaining technical matters, and my dedication to client satisfaction.</p>
